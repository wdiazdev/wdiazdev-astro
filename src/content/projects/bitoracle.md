**Bitoracle** is a cryptocurrency dashboard that allows users to track all their assets on one page and provides market data in real time.

**Routing:** The web application counts with multiple pages built with react router to better allows the user to navigate the content of the web application while maintaining the UI in sync with the URL.

**Authentication:** The authentication process is implemented with Google **Firebase** services and has an easy-to-follow UI and UX. The users can create new accounts, sign in, sign out, and recover passwords by email.

**Data Fetching:** To handle communication with the server over HTTP, the project uses **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client for **Node.js** and the browser.

**User Interface:** The UI components were built from scratch with vanilla **CSS3** in combination with **JavaScript** conditional statements to dynamically add styles based on market data and user interaction.

**Dashboard:** The dashboard page is protected. Only users who are logged in will have access to the Dashboard. On this page, the user will be able to create, read, update, and delete their entries following the **CRUD** computer programming model.
