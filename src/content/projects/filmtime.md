**Film Time** is designed to let users explore **movies** and **TV shows**, see trending/upcoming/popular titles, and save their personal favorites to a protected account. It blends interactive UI elements with user authentication and data persistence, creating a personalized experience.

**Routing:** The web application has multiple pages built with React Router, allowing users to navigate the content while keeping the UI in sync with the URL.

**Authentication:** The authentication process is implemented with Google **Firebase** services and offers an easy-to-follow **UI/UX**. Users can create new accounts, sign in, sign out, and recover passwords by email.

**Data Fetching:** To handle communication with the server over HTTP, the project uses **Axios**, a promise-based HTTP client for Node.js and the browser.

**Home page:** The movie and TV show pages are dynamically rendered and provide a different user interface on every page reload. This component displays the item name, tagline, release date, and two buttonsâ€”one for more information and another to play the associated videos.

In addition, users can navigate through the card sliders to see what is trending, upcoming, popular, or top-rated. These cards include a hover effect that enhances interactivity (e.g., more info or play).
